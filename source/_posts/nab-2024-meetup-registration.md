The CCSUBS group invites you to a meet-up at [NAB 2024](https://nabshow.com/2024/).

Topic
: Interoperability challenges in live captioning and subtitling for streaming

When
: April 15, 2024 from 13:00 to 17:00

Where
: Las Vegas, NV, USA

The subtitling and captioning ecosystem remains fragmented by technology and practices. This makes it expensive, if not impossible, to deliver great experiences. This unique event will bring together 30 technology experts from streaming services, studios, browser vendors, and suppliers to explore these challenges.

The program will be split into three parts:

* workshop on interoperability challenges in _live captioning and subtitling for
streaming_, where live means low-latency between authoring and presentation,
i.e. not pre-recorded;
* *unconference* where participants will have the opportunity to bring additional
problem statements for discussion by the group;
* discussion on *next steps towards a community for timed text experts*.

We ask that participants not disclosed publicly the discussions held during the
meet-up without approval from the program committee chairs; and no press is
allowed at the meet-up. We however plan on publishing a report following the
meet-up.

The [application](https://forms.gle/VKD2NTGeWbA4C4P5A) deadline is February 10,
2024. Space is limited. A response to your application will be provided on
February 15, 2024.

Thanks to our sponsors _there is no registration fee_.

Program committee: Pierre-Anthony Lemieux (Sandflow Consulting), Andreas Tai
(a2a11y), Eric Carlson (Apple), Cyril Concolato (Netflix), Flavio Ribeiro
(Netflix), Ken Harrenstien (YouTube) and Bill McLaughlin (AI-Media).
